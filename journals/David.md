# Journaling

## Guidelines
* The date of the entry
* A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable.
* A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small.

* Today, the group got together and we identified bounded contexts within our application. Initially, it seemed very daunting, but breaking down the models and grouping them into their respective microservices, really helped give a sense of foundation and structure before we even began coding. We also identified our value objects and the relationships between the models, i.e.: one-to-many, many-to-many, etc. 

* Things really clicked for me when we were able to identify what it was that we wanted inside each of our microservices and realizing what the value objects were.

* Ariana, Brandon, Cameron, and I worked together to figure out the API endpoints needed and we also went through the apis.md file to decide on the input and output for the individual API endpoints. 

* During our discussion, it was difficult to pinpoint what input was needed for each endpoint and what the output would be as well. Specifically, remembering whether or not the output would have an object returned inside of the JSON, like "restaurant" would return only
a single value or an entire restaurant object. 

* Being able to have a visualization of the layout of our application by creating wireframes and also documenting it in the ghi.md file helped me
gain a better understanding of the functionality of our application and how to make things efficient from the user's standpoint.

    * Each restaurant profile will have a calendar that keeps track of business hours and reservations
        * Each restaurant owner will need to specify the maximum number of reservations a restaurant can take per 1-hour or 30-minute slot (TBD by CuisineCoders). Once those slots are filled, the restaurant won’t be able to take any more reservations for that slot.
        * Embed calendar into each restaurant’s page
    * There will be a calendar per city/zip (TBD by CuisineCoders) that keeps track of advertisement slots.
        * Restaurant owners can pay for advertisement slots to have their restaurant show up higher on searches during specific times. For example, a restaurant owner can pay $x (TBD on how the price will be set) for the 6-7pm slot on specific dates, so their restaurant will show up toward the top of the page when a diner/foodie searches for restaurants in that city/zip (TBD by CuisineCoders) during 6-7pm on the specific dates the restaurant owner paid for.
